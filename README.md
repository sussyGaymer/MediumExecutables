# MediumExecutables
Heavily inspired by [pieconsumer's work](https://github.com/pieconsume/SmallExecutables).
The premise is the same, but I focused on the Windows PE format instead of the ELF format.

# Building
Most files here should be in plain binary format so you can build them using `nasm -f bin -o out\file.exe file.asm`.
If the process is any different, I will include a comment with the instructions at the top of the source file.
